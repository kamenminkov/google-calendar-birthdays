## TODO

- Implement a check for existing birthday notifications
- Find a better dev loop. Right now the browser has to be reloaded manually every time changes are pushed.
- Explore the option to use the built-in Google Birthdays calendar instead of contacts
- Find a more straightforward way to run the browser and the script and to get the needed permissions initially
- Find a way for the script to run every time the contacts are changed
